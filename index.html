        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">FC Barcelona</strong> commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known
        as
        Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La
        Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.

        Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, German and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has
        become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club").
        Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable
        sports team in the world, worth $4.76 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue,
        with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.[2][3] The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written
        by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and red stripes,
        hence nicknamed Blaugrana.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 75 trophies: 26 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, thirteen Supercopa de España,
        three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four
        competitions. In international club football, the club has won twenty European and worldwide titles: five UEFA
        Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record
        three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[5] Barcelona was ranked first in the
        International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and
        2015, and occupies the sixth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2022.[6][7][8] The club has a
        long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.
      </p>
      <p>
        Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social
        media following in the world among sports teams.[9][10] Barcelona players have won a record twelve Ballon d'Or
        awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards,
        with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the
        club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world
        in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy. Additionally,
        players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top
        division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the
        first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions
        League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by
        also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.[11] In 2011, the club became
        European champions again, winning five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four
        years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[12][13][14]
        By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015, Barcelona became the first European football club in
        history to achieve the continental treble twice.

          <h3>FC Barcelona</h3>

            On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a
            football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players
            attended – Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto
            Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and
            Foot-Ball
            Club Barcelona was born.[16][17]


            A formation of FC Barcelona in 1903
            FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya
            and
            the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first
            Copa
            del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final.[18] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became
            club
            president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on
            the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de
            Catalunya
            in 1905. He said in a meeting, "Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to
            try,
            then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on."[19] Club president on five separate
            occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was
            ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[20]
